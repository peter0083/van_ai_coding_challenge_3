### Observation

1. This training set has 550k rows of data with 12 columns. There are 5 discrete columns and 7 continuous columns.

> This data set has a good ratio of observations per feature. It may not be safe to assume that I have avoided the curse of dimensionality problem because I have not converted the discrete features into dummy variables yet.
